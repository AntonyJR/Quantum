# Quantum Computer Gates

This is a Python implementation of the exercises suggested in the paper [Undergraduate computational physics projects on quantum computing][Candela1] (Can1)
The original code was written by my son James Hurford-Reynolds.
I have refactored his code to make it easier to reuse.
